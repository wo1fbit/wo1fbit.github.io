## The journey: Learning Web Security. 

Learning Web Security can be quite challenging, confusing and hard to know where to begin. It is even harder when you do not have somebody to guide you. After much moving aimlessly and learning just whatever, I decide to sit down and work out a plan to learn in an aimful manner. 
This is what I came up with. In school and pretty much any other place where learning takes place, you don't just start learning anyhowly, you have something or someone to guide you. This could be a book, syllabus, a mentor, a trainer.
I need a guide that would help me learn slowly and progressively with a great outcome. However, I know the journey will be difficult and I will have some setbacks along the way but I'm actually looking forward to them. 
They will help me to build myself along the way. From the past, learning something after struggles and setbacks gives quite an exhilarating and satisfying feeling. Almost otherwordly.

After doing much research I finally find a school that will teach me what I yearn for. The internet will be my school, the OWASP my guide and [portswigger](https://portswigger.net/) my teacher. I will be using the OWASP top ten.

# What is OWASP?

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a non-profit global community that strives to promote application security across the web. A core OWASP principle is that their knowledge base is freely and easily accessible on their website. With its tens of thousands of members and hundreds of chapters, OWASP is considered highly credible, and developers have come to count on it for essential web application security guidance.

Every application developer, regardless of experience level, must make the effort to understand code security vulnerabilities in order to avoid frustrating and often costly application security failures.

# What is the OWASP top ten?

Every few years, OWASP revises and publishes its list of the top 10 web application vulnerabilities. The list includes not only the OWASP Top 10 threats but also the potential impact of each vulnerability and how to avoid them. The comprehensive list is compiled from a variety of expert sources such as security consultants, security vendors, and security teams from companies and organizations of all sizes. It is recognized as an essential guide to web application security best practices.

OWASP has recently shared the 2021 OWASP Top 10 where there are three new categories, four categories with naming and scoping changes, and some consolidation within the Top 10.

The OWASP Top 10 is largely intended to raise awareness. However, since its debut in 2003, enterprises have used it as a de facto industry AppSec standard. If we look at the document closely, it specifically calls out the number of CWEâ€™s (Common Weakness Enumeration) attached with it.


Before the next OWASP top ten is updated I will use it as a guide and learn every vulnerability in it's list. There is no doubt that I will be introduced to new materials and concepts hthat I will learn as I tackle each item and clear them one by one.

As of now February, 28th 2022, the OWASP top ten comprises of:

* A01:2021-Broken Access Control
* A02:2021-Cryptographic Failures
* A03:2021-Injection
* A04:2021-Insecure Design
* A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration
* A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components
* A07:2021-Identification and Authentication Failures
* A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity Failures
* A09:2021-Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
* A10:2021-Server-Side Request Forgery

The list above is written such that the most critical Vulnerability is at the top.
I will cover all the vulnerabilities above in a detailed manner as I do my research.

The journey has began.

See you on the other side,
