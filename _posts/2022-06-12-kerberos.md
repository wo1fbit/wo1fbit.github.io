# Understanding Kerberos
---

Recently I was doing a box on HTB that required knowledge on Kerberos to successfully attack and get into the machine. After some research I found this gem [MIT Docs on Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/dialogue.html) that helped me understand kerberos. This guide/article (whatever) is to simplify the whole thing.

## What is a protocol?
~~~
In computer networks, a protocol is a set of rules or guidelines on how data is trasmitted between devices.
~~~

## What is Kerberos?
~~~
Kerberos is an authentication protocol that is used to authenticate users over an insecure network based on tickets.

How Kerberos Works
---
So, you work in a big office full of computers and devices. You want to read your email from the mail server. You're not the only one. The company wants to make sure that the wrong people don't get access to their resources. How will the company make sure this doesn't happen: that it's you and not a hacker that is printing the file or accessing mail.....Kerberos

Parties Involved
----------------
1. You
2. Mail Client 
3. Mail Server - running the mail service
4. Kerberos
5. Kinit - ticket-giving service

# Steps
--
1. You give kinit your username
2. Kinit contacts kerberos and passes to your username.
3. Kerberos contacts the database (e.g Active Directory) to look up for your name. If it finds the username, it gives you a ticket granting ticket (TGT)(-the work of this TGT is to prove that you authenticated yourself and you can use it to request tickets that give you access to other services-). Kerberos encrypts this TGT with the **correct password** of the user. Kerberos also generates a session key that will be used later. It then forwards this session key to the mail server and the encrypted TGT to kinit.

                       ===========================
                       |    TGT  Contents        |     * username - person who requested the service
                       ===========================     * address - address of the computer from where the request came from
                       | username                |     * lifespan - how long the TGT is valid
                       | address                 |     * timestamp - when the ticket was issued
                       | lifespan                |     * session key - used to confirm the identity of the user to the TGS
                       | timestamp               |     * service name - to identify the service being requested
                       | session key             | 
                       | service name            |     **All these are added to make sure the correct people use the services**
                       ===========================

4. Kinit recieves the encrypted TGT packet and asks for a password.
