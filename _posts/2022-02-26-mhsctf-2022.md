Overall, the ctf was easy (in regard to web). The CTF was jeopardy-style and covered:
* General/Misc
* Cryptography
* Forensics
* Web Exploits
* Reverse Engineering
* Pwn

As usual I was with my team [Fr334aks-mini](https://twitter.com/fr334aksmini) and Web Exploits.

![freaksmini](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96860148/155076562-8534d0f7-ef23-4465-9f03-7dd87d59d550.png)


In total there were eight web challenges. I managed to solve four of them while my teammates solved the other four.
I will also touch on 1 other that I managed to solve but were solved before i got started.

## Challenges
* James Harold Japp - 10 points
* new site who dis? - 20 points(Solved by teammate)
* Piece it together - 25 points
* Cuppa Joe- 30 points
* Practice for School - 55 points

### Challenge 1: James Harold Japp - 10 pts.
The vulnerability in this challenge is number one in the OWASP top ten vulnerabilities [**A01:2021-Broken Access Control**](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/). You can read more about it in [Portswigger's Access control vulnerabilities and privilege escalation](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control).

The mission of this challenge was to login to a site and get the flag. We're directed to a login page that looked like this:

![login page 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96860148/155074245-0b396d9f-c2e0-4238-b8da-9d6dddbd8fb8.png)

#### Page-source:
```
<head>
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lato:wght@300&family=Exo+2&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://mhsctf-webexploitdata.0xmmalik.repl.co/style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="w3-content">
    <label for="pwd">Password:</label>
    <input type="password" id="pwd" name="pwd">
    <button onclick="validatepwd()" type="button">Submit</button>

    <script>
      function validatepwd() {
        var x = document.getElementById("pwd").value;
        if (x == "this_is_a_really_secure_password") {
          window.open("/weirdpage.php?pwd=doublepassword")
        }
      }
    </script>
  </div>
</body>
```
Now we've got the password for the login --> **this_is_a_really_secure_password**. The script is supposed to open a new url **/weirdpage.php?pwd=doublepassword** if the password is right..

However on heading to the redirection url....

![not found](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96860148/155075305-0a63d5d8-779e-4948-ad11-d71404e6bc76.png)

But what does the source code have to say....

```
<!doctype html><html><head><!--lol gottem here's the flag: flag{1n$p3ct0r_g3n3r@l}--><title>404 Not Found</title><style>
body { background-color: #fcfcfc; color: #333333; margin: 0; padding:0; }
h1 { font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: normal; background-color: #9999cc; min-height:2em; line-height:2em; border-bottom: 1px inset black; margin: 0; }
h1, p { padding-left: 10px; }
code.url { background-color: #eeeeee; font-family:monospace; padding:0 2px;}
</style>
</head><body><h1>Not Found</h1><p>The requested resource <code class="url">/weirdpage.php?pwd=doublepassword</code> was not found on this server.</p></body></html>
```
Now we've got 10 points on our side.

#### Mitigation

1. Use strong passwords with eight or more characers. The characters should comprise of both small and capital letters, numbers, special char and the password should also be unexpected. Also don't use default creds. Change them once you have the security control measure in.
2. Don't use scripts in the client side to authenticate users. Some obfuscation is good but thats bad. Use a database and PHP. This way your code is more secure.

### Challenge 2:  new site who dis? - 20pts (solved earlier before me).
Heading to this challenge we're taken to this site that says....

![new site](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96860148/155796372-69a887a8-f6ab-4d4b-bccd-c314b00cecc6.png)

On clicking the link we're taken to another that says....

![wrong user](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96860148/155797128-8b9703b1-713e-49c8-ab17-a7a9b139658c.png)

Checking the results, we can guess that the flag page is using something to confirm whether I am an admin or not. I check the cookies to see if there is anything and I find one with the name user and has the value basic. I guess this is it. I change the value to admin, reload the page and voila! I get the flag.

#### Mitigation

1. Don't use obvious cookies that show what their use is for.
2. Use session identifiers. These have their own issues, but won't let people break things quite so easily.

### Challenge 3: Piece It Together - 25pts.
![login](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96860148/155802766-2ca32c3a-acfe-406e-aed4-57a40f0a63ac.png)

What does the DOM selection source have to say...
```
<div class="w3-content">
    <h2>Login</h2>
    <script>
var _0xa8fe=["\x34\x77","\x64\x7D","\x67\x7B","\x6A","\x7D","\x31\x67","\x77\x30","\x72","\x61\x6C","\x73","\x68\x37","\x61\x67\x7B","\x66\x6C","\x6D\x33\x74","\x76\x61\x6C\x75\x65","\x70\x77\x64","\x67\x65\x74\x45\x6C\x65\x6D\x65\x6E\x74\x42\x79\x49\x64","\x59\x65\x70\x2C\x20\x74\x68\x61\x74\x27\x73\x20\x74\x68\x65\x20\x66\x6C\x61\x67\x21","\x53\x6F\x72\x72\x79\x2C\x20\x74\x68\x61\x74\x27\x73\x20\x6E\x6F\x74\x20\x74\x68\x65\x20\x66\x6C\x61\x67\x21"];function checkpwd(){if(document[_0xa8fe[16]](_0xa8fe[15])[_0xa8fe[14]]== (_0xa8fe[12]+ _0xa8fe[11]+ _0xa8fe[3]+ _0xa8fe[5]+ _0xa8fe[9]+ _0xa8fe[0]+ _0xa8fe[4])){alert(_0xa8fe[17])}else {alert(_0xa8fe[18])}}
    </script>

    <label for="pwd">Password:</label>
    <input type="text" id="pwd" name="pwd">
    <button onclick="checkpwd()">Submit</button>
  </div>
  ```
  The javascript has been obfuscated. My guess is the obfuscated javascript is validating the password. So I head over to [deobfuscate.io](https://deobfuscate.io/) to deobfuscate.
  ```
  function checkpwd() {
  if (document.getElementById("pwd").value == "flag{j1gs4w}") {
    alert("Yep, that's the flag!");
  } else {
    alert("Sorry, that's not the flag!");
  }
}
```
The flag is right there...**flag{j1gs4w}**

#### Mitigation.
1. Don't use client side scripts to authenticate users. Use a database and php. This makes your site more secure.

### Challenge 4: Cuppa Joe - 3pts.
![cuppa joe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96860148/155804688-3b9e2c10-4292-49e4-a4e4-df38548ca96b.png)

At first on viewing the web page, the firt thing that came on my mind was XSS and true enough inserting and submitting 

```<script>alert(1)</script>``` in the query gives out

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96860148/155805689-a3707833-d254-48d5-b90b-ed339cf4cc0c.png)

However this would be a very deep rabbit hole..so i continue to interact with the page. The **flag.php** looks inviting but on clicking nothing changes except the url which changes from 

https://mhsctf-cuppajoe.0xmmalik.repl.co/ to https://mhsctf-cuppajoe.0xmmalik.repl.co/TODO%20fill%20out%20the%20links.

So i check the page source code which seals the fate...
```
<head>
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
  <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lato:wght@300&family=Exo+2&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/4/w3.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://mhsctf-webexploitdata.0xmmalik.repl.co/style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="w3-content">
    <h2>Cuppa Joe</h2>
    <div class="sidenav">
    Sitemap:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="TODO fill out the links">index.php</a></li>
        <li><a href="TODO fill out the links">flag.php</a></li>
        <li><a href="TODO fill out the links">message.php</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    Welcome to Cuppa Joe! We're a coffee shop that... loves coffee! Our website is still under construction so don't be going around and exploiting us ;)<br /><br />Leave us a message in the meantime!<br /><br />

    <form action="message.php" method="POST">
      <label for="message">Your message:</label><br />
      <textarea name="message" id="message" rows="5" cols="50" style="height:30%;"></textarea><br />
      <input type="submit">
    </form>
  </div>
</body>
```
The href="TODO fill out the links" jumps at me that I'm supposed to fill out the links with their proper reference. Because I'm only interested with the flag I use the browser inspector to change href="TODO fill out the links"  to href="flag.php". Clicking the new link I get the flag ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96860148/155806787-84a03daa-6cef-46cd-9a08-6ec0b2dea9af.png).

### Challenge 5:  Practice For School - 55pts.
This one was tricky. We're provided with a link to an edpuzzle classroom https://edpuzzle.com/assignments/60c90ddeffb96f416707e09d/watch. 

In the challenge description the author gives a note **Note: the video is 168 hours (1 week) long so you will not be able to watch through the whole thing. :)**
Well we could do that by forwarding the video. Now this is where I started scratching my head (but not for long). The youtube video had no controls and no way to forward it!!! Also the edpuzzle control bar was locked. There is a multiple-choice task that is activated when the video reached a time.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96860148/155815453-cceeceae-06e2-43e0-aa9b-994462624864.png)

I had to find a way to forward the video. The youtube video was an iframe suggesting that it had controls of its own. It then occurred to me that the controls were removed when the iframe was being loaded. I had to find a way to interceptthe request  Now comes burpsuite. I loaded burpsuite to intercept the iframe request and sure enough I intercepted the rogue request :)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96860148/155810028-40f62e3f-08ad-4e67-95af-d6902b5bf504.png)

So i change controls=0 to controls=1 and now we have a control bar.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96860148/155813751-d1a262e3-64ca-4a31-8710-466cc2781f8d.png)

Then **IMPORTANT** drag the control all the way to the end to reveal the multiple-choice question and finally the flag.

All in all the CTF was awesome and a little challenging. Thanks to the MHSCTF team for the CTF. Looking forward for more CTFs from them.
That's all i've got for this CTF.

Till next CTF,
Parsz.
